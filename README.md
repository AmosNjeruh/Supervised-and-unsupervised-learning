# Supervised-and-unsupervised-learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, mapping input to output (e.g., classification, regression). In contrast, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to identify patterns or groupings (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction). Both techniques are core in machine learning tasks.
